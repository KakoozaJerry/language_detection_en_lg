# language detection from text for English and Luganda

This will include text used and the notebook

PS: 

The large vocab csv file needs alot of RAM to compute , therefore I propose using the smaller vocab csv

The notebook identified here was run using google colab 

You can find the csv file for either the larger or smaller vocab in the data folder
